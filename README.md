# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
The project is to showcase our SQL fundamentals and knowledge of SQL queries to apply to this mock dataset from a fictitious e-commerce company.  The goal is to improve its original raw data, despite information being inaccurate, inconsistent, duplicated, and missing, by cleaning, transforming, and analyzing, as well as identifying risk areas for our methods of quality assurance, and get meaningful results.  

## Process
1. 
### (your step 2)

## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)

## Challenges 
- Time is not on our side, as we are given up to 5 days to complete the SQL Final Project.
- Ambiguity of questions being asked to answer as it depends on our individual responses and the validity of our reasoning to the audience.
- Putting the lectures and modules learned daily from the Bootcamp to use to simulate real-life practice, especially tackling on an enormous dataset.
- Getting used to reading the error messages flagged by pgAdmin 4 and understand what they mean.
- Figuring out how to input SQL code in proper sequence to get the data output.  With long lists of code, it can be difficult to pin down data entry mistakes and typos.

## Future Goals
- Better use of time and efficiencies to gather, sort, and obtain the results in a short stint of time.
- Learn intermidate and advanced SQL functions to apply different combinations of code to achieve various desired outcomes.
- Not only do I like expand and sharpen my understanding of the SQL language, but I would like to gain insight of the data from a business perspective.  For the SQL Final Project in particular, I would have liked to know how an e-commerce operates and understand what sort of information is important and relevant to their stakeholders.
